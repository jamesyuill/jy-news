# JY News API

Hi there,

Welcome to the very first API I have ever created.

You can access all the endpoint fun [here](https://jy-news.onrender.com/api/).



The first will be ".env.test". This will contain "PGDATABASE=nc_news_test"

The second will be ".env.development". This will contain "PGDATABASE=nc_news"
