# Northcoders News API

Hi there,

In order to clone and run this project locally, you will need to create two envirmoent variable files (.env.).

The first will be ".env.test". This will contain "PGDATABASE=nc_news_test"

The second will be ".env.development". This will contain "PGDATABASE=nc_news"

These are stored in the top level of the folders
